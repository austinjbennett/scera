== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does WordPress Zero Spam check Ninja Forms submissions? =

**No.** As of v4.10.0, WordPress Zero Spam no longer checks Ninja Form submissions. Support was dropped due to its [requirement of JavaScript](https://developer.ninjaforms.com/codex/loading-the-form-via-ajax/) and how it submits forms. JavaScript is one of the techniques WordPress Zero Spam uses to determine if a submission is spam. Ninja Forms employs a similar method and has its own [spam detection](https://ninjaforms.com/blog/spam-wordpress-form/) feature.

**Does this mean WPZP won't do you any good? Absolutely not.** WPZS employs other techniques and IP blacklist checks that will help prevent malicious IP and spambots from ever seeing your site. You will still get all of the benefits of this plugin, it just won't provide the extra check on Ninja Form submissions.

= Does WordPress Zero Spam check Gravity Form submissions? =

**No.** As of v4.9.9, WordPress Zero Spam no longer checks Gravity Form submissions. Support was dropped due the numerous addon plugins that can be installed & alter GF submissions. These addons will often conflict with how WPZS validates submissions. In addition, Gravity Forms already has a spam detection option that works  similar to how this plugin detects forms. You can enable it by going to the form settings and checking the *Enable anti-spam honeypot* option. For more information, see [Gravity Forms documentation](https://docs.gravityforms.com/form-settings/).

**Does this mean WPZP won't do you any good? Absolutely not.** WPZS employs other techniques and IP blacklist checks that will help prevent malicious IP and spambots from ever seeing your site. You will still get all of the benefits of this plugin, it just won't provide the extra check on Gravity Form submissions.

= Does WordPress Zero Spam check Jetpack comments? =

**No.** WordPress Zero Spam is unable to integrate Jetpack. For more information, see [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatible-with-jetpack-comments](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/incompatible-with-jetpack-comments).

= Spam coments are still getting through, help! =

WordPress Zero Spam relies on the default core form id (`#commentform`) in order to check comment submissions. Verify your comment forms have this ID or add the class `wpzerospam` to enable it on your site.

= All registrations are marked as spam, help! =

This is most likely due to a plugin or theme overriding the default markup of the registration form. Verify the form has an id of `registerform` or add the `wpzerospam` class to it.

Example with `registerform` id:

`<form name="registerform" id="registerform" action="https://yourdomain.local/login/?action=register" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">`

Example with `wpzerospam` class:

`<form name="registerform" class="wpzerospam" action="https://yourdomain.local/login/?action=register" method="post" novalidate="novalidate">`

If you need help, please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://benmarshall.me/contact/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_zero_spam).

= How do I integrate this into another plugin or theme? =

It's easy as adding the class `wpzerospam` to the `form` element, then adding a check in the form processor that the `wpzerospam_key` post value matches the option value in the database using the `wpzerospam_key_check()` helper function. See the [plugin's documentation](https://benmarshall.me/wordpress-zero-spam/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=wordpress_zero_spam) for more information on available hooks & functions.

= Is JavaScript required to check form submissions? =

Yes. One of the many techniques WordPress Zero Spam employs requires JavaScript be enabled to work properly.

= Does WordPress Zero Spam use cookies? =

**Yes. It does not store any kind of personally identifiable information.** Only one cookie is stored (`wpzerospam_api_blacklist`) to log the last time the site queried the blacklist APIs. This is used to boost performance so each page visit doesn't trigger an API call. The expiration can be set in *Admin > WP Zero Spam > Settings*
